This Python script leverages the Kansas Geocoder to geocode addresses. Three options for geocoding are provided-

- Geocoding a table by single line input
- Geocoding a table by parsed fields
- Geocoding defined addresses (single line & parsed examples given)

The python script was initially developed by Esri then edited by Mike D'Attilio with the Kansas Adjutant General's Office.

Final script tweaks were made by Kristen Jordan Koenig with the Kansas Data Access and Support Center (DASC).
